Your Cellphone
--------------
Your cellphone is a very special item, but has limited batteries.

You can use it to generate interference that dismantles hardware,
like elevators control and gate access panels.

You can also use it to play if you are bored.

Too bad your calling service is cancelled and thus you cant call
for help... you must have paid it instead of buying that blue cap!


We are the architects, we designed this building.

We wonder if along all these years you have liked the window design, which was our main concern.
